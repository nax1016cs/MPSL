In this lesson, I learned how to write assembly code and control the electronic appliance with c code.
In the final project, my teamate and I make a mini hand football machine. It can help players count the scores, and display the remaining time of the competition. Moreover, as one of the play shoot the ball in the goal, the buzzers rings and the time will stop until the ball was taken out.
With high accuracy and beautiful appearance, we got fourth place out of forty-five groups.
